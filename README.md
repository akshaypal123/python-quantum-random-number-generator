# Quantum Algorithms with Cirq in Python
## Introduction

This project is a small foray into the world of quantum computing in Python using the using the [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) library. I have built a quantum random number generator largely following tutorials and documentation written by the Cirq team at Google, published [here](https://quantumai.google/cirq/experiments/textbook_algorithms) deepening both my theoretical quantum computng knowledge and my Python coding ability!
